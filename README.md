🧮 3×3 Linear Equation Solver (HTML + JS)

A simple, interactive web app that solves systems of three linear equations with three variables (x, y, z) using Gaussian elimination — step by step.
Built with only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, no frameworks or libraries required.

🌟 Features

✅ Solves any 3×3 linear system using Gaussian elimination with pivoting

🧠 Shows every elimination step and back-substitution

🧩 Beginner-friendly interface — just type numbers and hit Solve

📘 Includes a Load Example button that verifies the solver’s correctness (x = -1, y = 7, z = 4)

💻 100% client-side — no servers, no dependencies

🧰 How It Works

The app uses Gaussian elimination — a core linear algebra method that systematically removes variables to find a unique solution.
Each step is printed so students can follow the logic behind every row operation.

Example equation system:

2x +  y -  z =  1
 x -  y + 2z =  0
3x + 2y +  z = 15


Expected solution:

x = -1
y = 7
z = 4
